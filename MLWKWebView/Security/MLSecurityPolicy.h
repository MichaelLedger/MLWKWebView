 SSL Pinning Modes
 The following constants are provided by `AXSSLPinningMode` as possible SSL pinning modes.

 - MLSSLPinningModeNone: Do not used pinned certificates to validate servers.
 - MLSSLPinningModePublicKey: Validate host certificates against public keys of pinned certificates.
 - MLSSLPinningModeCertificate: Validate host certificates against pinned certificates.

 `MLSecurityPolicy` evaluates server trust against pinned X.509 certificates and public keys over secure connections.
 
 Adding pinned SSL certificates to your app helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and other vulnerabilities. Applications dealing with sensitive customer data or financial information are strongly encouraged to route all communication over an HTTPS connection with SSL pinning configured and enabled.
